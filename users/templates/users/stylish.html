    <h1>hello!</h1>
    <p>oh christ that header is massive. <i>well</i>, it is <u>heading 1</u> after all, which is the largest.</p>
    <h2>hi there!</h2>
    <p>
      okay... thats a lil smaller. yes, that above us is <u>heading 2</u>. oh, yeah, i should also let you know that this is a page just to <b>test</b> all my <b>styling</b> and <b>css</b> tidbits.
    </p>
    <p>
      <del>aint much interesting here</del>. unless you like:
      <ul>
        <li>reading what a <b>silly girl</b> types;</li>
        <li>clicking on a <a href="#">silly link</a> for funsies;</li>
        <li>pretty colours and nice aesthetics (hopefully).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>bonjour!</h3>
    <p>
      gosh. a <u>third</u> section. <i>with more to come</i>. we.. <u>might</u> need some lipsum in here. or <i>perhaps something cool</i>? that would probably be <u>ideal</u>. because lipsum is boring but i do need some long strings of text. just for <b>testing</b>, y'know? in fact, i am pretty good at rambling, so this may do the trick. albeit a little embarrassing. or is it <i>fun and <u>unique</u> and quirky?</i> up to you really.
    </p>
    <p>
      ah, yes, for the sake of throwing out different elements and styles, lets have a nice ordered list. lets do... uh.. how about the <b>languages</b> i know bits and pieces of, in order of my level of fluency?
      <ol>
        <li><b>english</b> - it is my <u>native language</u>, so one would hope im <i>relatively</i> decent with it. right?</li>
        <li><b>french</b> - studied for <u>five years</u> in little school. it was definitely a favourite subject of mine. (i am a massive teachers pet btw)</li>
        <li><b>swedish</b> - i had some good ol buddies and <u>gamer pals</u> from sweden and went over there quite a bit in my teen years.</li>
        <li><b>japanese</b> - because i am <b>kawaii desu ne. =^_^=</b> P.S. my favourite kana is 空, which is "sora", meaning "sky," but also "empty".</li>
        <li><b>polish</b> - <del>lawd help me</del> what a beautiful language.</li>
      </ol>

    <h4>hejsan!</h4>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, beneath the boughs of ancient oaks, where the earth breathes beneath our feet and the winds carry the whispers of old. The rhythm of nature pulses through the air, steady and unyielding as the tides that shape the shores. Yet here we are, lost in the thicket of our own tangled thoughts, as if we could ever understand the song of the stars or the hidden wisdom of the moss-clad stones. The roots of our forebears run deep, but do we listen?</p>
    <h5>konnichiwa!</h5>
    <p>Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ah, the delicate dance of the seasons, each step a reminder that all things must fade and return, like the leaf that falls from the tree only to rise again in the spring’s embrace. To toil, to labor, to feel the sting of the cold wind on our faces—that is the way of the world. Yet the earth cradles us, offering peace in the chaos, teaching us that perhaps all things come with purpose, even if we never see it.</p>
    <h6>cześć!</h6>
    <p>Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident. And still, we wander the forests of our minds, searching for what is lost, knowing that answers do not lie in stone and steel, but in the quiet rustle of leaves, the song of the brook, and the embrace of the wild winds. It is the dance of life, unpredictable, untamed, yet beautiful in its own right. We are but one leaf in the endless forest, fluttering and swaying to a rhythm older than time itself.</p>
