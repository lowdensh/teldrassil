      </p>

      <h2>hi there!</h2>
      <p>

      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>reading what a <b>silly girl</b> types;</li>
        <li>clicking on <a href="#">silly links</a> for funsies;</li>

        Hi, future Shona here! I just wanted to note that <i>actually</i> I had <b>a lot of fun</b> making this page here! And I <i>do</i> believe it has interesting things to see indeed. ^_^ Anyways, feel free to continue onwards on your scrolling journey~
      </p>

      <h3>bonjour!</h3>
      <p>
        oh? <i>another one?</i> say hello to <u>heading 3</u>. we might need some lipsum in here, just for <b>testing</b>, y'know? but i think many of us are tired of plain ol' lipsum by now. in fact, i am pretty good at rambling, so this may well do the trick.
      </p>
      <p>
        ah, yes, for the sake of throwing out different elements and styles, lets have a nice <u>ordered list</u>. how about the <b>languages</b> i know bits and pieces of, in order of my level of fluency?
        <ol>
          <li><b>english</b> - its my <u>native language</u>. so, one would hope im <i>relatively</i> decent with it, right?</li>
          <li><b>french</b> - studied for <u>five years</u> in little school. it was definitely a favourite subject of mine (i am a massive teachers pet btw).</li>
          <li><b>swedish</b> - i had some good ol buddies, <u>gamer pals</u>, and my first partner from sweden. i went over there quite a bit in my teen years.</li>
          <li><b>japanese</b> - because i am <b>kawaii desu ne? =^_^=</b> P.S. my favourite kana is Á©∫, romanised as "sora", meaning "sky," but also "empty". a beautiful double entendre.</li>
          <li><b>polish</b> - <del>lawd help me</del> a simple and intuitive language.</li>

        <i>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</i> üçÉ Beneath the boughs of ancient elven oaks, where the <b>earth breathes</b> beneath our feet and the winds carry the whispers of old, the <b>rhythm of nature</b> pulses through the air. She is as steady and unyielding as the tides that shape the shores. And yet, here we are: <b>lost in the thicket of our own tangled thoughts</b>; we wander, as if we could ever understand the <b>songs of the stars</b> or the hidden wisdom of the moss-clad rocks in the rivers. ‚ú®

      <h5 class="u-full">konnichiwa!</h5>
      <p>
        <i>Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</i> üçÉ The delicate dance of the seasons: a reminder that all things must <b>fade and return</b>, like a leaf that falls from a tree, only to rise again in the spring‚Äôs embrace. To toil, to labour, to feel the sting of the cold wind‚Äîthat is the way of the world. And yet, the earth cradles us: offering <b>peace in the chaos</b>; teaching us that perhaps all things come with purpose, even if we never see it. ‚ú®

      <h6 class="u-full">cze≈õƒá!</h6>
      <p>
        <i>Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident.</i> üçÉ And still, we wander the <b>forests of our minds</b>, searching for what is lost! All while knowing that answers do not lie in flesh, but in the whisper of the wind, the serenade of the river, the warming embrace of the sunrise. It is the <b>dance of life</b>: unpredictable, untamed, beautiful in its own right. We are but one leaf in the endless forest, fluttering and swaying to the <b>rhythm of nature</b>, older than time itself. ‚ú®

        And now! <b>Behold!</b> I demonstrate the <u>Bootstrap</u> flexy container grid system. We love these lil rows and columns, yes we do. Neat little style classes to make everything <i>super easy</i>.

        <u>Ugly border warning for the below</u> (!!) Yes, I know, and I'm sorry, but ya girl has to check where things <b>start</b> and <b>end</b>, okay? And I find that <b>visualising</b> things tends to help me out (not just for <code>code</code>, but for learning anything, really).

      So, some things to note for the below are:
      <ul>
        <li>We have a nice <code>.container</code> with two <code>row</code> elements:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>The first <code>row</code> for headers,</li>
            <li>The last <code>row</code> for text content.</li>
          </ol>
        <li>Try and <b>resize</b> the window and check the <u>responsive breakpoints</u> here:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>The heading <code>col</code>s are gonna stack up with a <u>smaller viewport</u>.</li>
            <li>The text content <code>col</code>s will follow after all the headings, because they live in their own <code>row</code>.</li>
          </ol>
        <li><code>align-items-center</code> on a <code>.row</code> will y-axis centrally align the baby <code>col</code>s within in their <code>row</code>. Note how the <code>borders</code> show different heights of the <code>col</code>s.
        <li>Our baby heading <code>col</code>s have different styling:</li>
          <ol>
            <li><span class="text-warning">Heading One</span> has no text alignment, so goes to the left by default.</li>
            <li><span class="text-danger">Heading Two</span> has <code>text-center</code> alignment, so goes to the middle.</li>
            <li><span class="text-primary">Heading Three</span> has <code>text-end</code> alignment, so goes to the right.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Our baby text content <code>col</code>s have different styling too, described below as part of the actual content.</li>

        <b>Amidst</b> the emerald hush of the ancient wood, deep in the heart of Teldrassil, nature's secrets slumber beneath a canopy of stars. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth, vines of ivy curling like whispered spells, and lavender swaying in the breath of the wind. Rose petals, soft as moonlight, drift upon a nearby moonwell‚Äôs surface, carried by the murmured incantations of the sacred water. The fragrance of moss rises where roots embrace stone, melding with the crisp, resinous breath of ancient elven pines.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>And there</b>, beneath a tangle of tall grass and wild roses, two feminine figures linger‚Äîfingers tracing love notes into the soil, eyes reflecting the shimmer of the moonwell. Their laughter, low and honeyed, charms the night itself. The moonwell radiates gently and etches sigils of light upon the dusk, its glow dancing over roots entwined with pink and purple flora in full bloom. Here, where the roots run deep and the wind carries the verdant voices of nature, love blossoms‚Äîancient, untamed, and free.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-lg border border-danger rounded text-center align-self-center">

        Column in the centre: y-axis: <code>align-self-center</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>A breeze</b> stirs the lavender, carrying its perfume through the hush of the grove, as if the earth itself exhales in contentment. The moonwell hums its endless lullaby, its voice twining with the soft murmur of shared secrets and quiet confessions. Fingers trace the contours of flower petals, then skin, reverent as if touching something sacred.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The night</b>, wrapped in pine and roses, leans in to listen. In the distance, a hippogryph calls. A blessing, perhaps, or a witness to the quiet alchemy unfolding beneath the boughs. Time breathes and slows, unraveling like ivy, winding the figures ever closer. In the embrace of the wild, beneath the watchful canopy of stars, love lingers like the scent of moss after rain‚Äîdeep, quiet, and eternal.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-lg border border-primary rounded text-end align-self-end">
      <p>
        <b>Text Content Three</b>: bottom right. <br />

        Column at the bottom: y-axis: <code>align-self-end</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The forest</b> sighs, settling into stillness, as if cradling this precious moment in its ancient grasp. The whispers of the wind through tall grass is a lullaby, soft and all-knowing. High in the branches, the hippogryph sings, its song weaving silver threads through the calming quiet‚Äîa melody of love, of connection, of belonging. The moonwell glistens, reflecting the gentle glow of the stars, whilst the wild roses and lavender bow beneath the weight of the night‚Äôs hush.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Fingers</b> remain entwined, breaths slow and steady, as if the great mother tree itself inhales and exhales with them. Somewhere beyond the forest, the world beyond may still stir, but here‚Äîwhere roots hold the memories of old magic and the sky bends low to kiss the earth‚Äîall is calm. The hippogryph trills once more, a final benediction, before vanishing into the shadows. The forest watches over the figures as they drift into the emerald dream.
